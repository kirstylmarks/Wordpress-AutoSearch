## WORDPRESS - Auto Search

This is a small snippet plugin (or function add) to create an autosearch box which returns a list of pages / posts on a 
given keyword when typed into the box. This is using a basic keyup function and Wordpress Ajax to return the searched 
term. Currently returns a text link only, which links to the page / post in question.

The actual code for the search box can be added to any page via the HTML code, however i will be expanding this to 
possibly echo as a shortcode so this can be added to any page via the editor in future (this will be being tested)â‰ˆ
